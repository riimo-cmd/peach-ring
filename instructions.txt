Congrats on joining the peach ring! There's only have a javascript button avalible at this time, however I plan on making an image button ~eventually~. 

Add this code to your <head> tags:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://whiteheartrainbowsoul.neocities.org/peach-ring/onionring.css">

Add this code where you want to put the button:
<div id='Peach_Ring'>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://whiteheartrainbowsoul.neocities.org/peach-ring/onionring-variables.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://whiteheartrainbowsoul.neocities.org/peach-ring/onionring-widget.js"></script>
</div>

If you have any questions or if you wish to be removed from the webring, please contact me via the email address listed on the peach ring index page.
